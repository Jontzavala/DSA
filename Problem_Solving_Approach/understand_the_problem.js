// ===============================================================
// Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum.
// ===============================================================

// 1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
// - "Implement addition";

// 2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
// - ints?
// - floats?
// - what about string for large numbers?

// 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
// - ints? float? string?

// 4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?
// - What happens if there is only one number? Do we return null? or undefined?

// 5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
// - two parameters num1 and num2. Value returned should be sum
